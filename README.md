# 🧮 Respiratory Calculator – FNB App Academy Project
This project was built as part of the FNB App Academy learning journey, where we combined the foundational web technologies – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – to create a simple, interactive Respiratory Calculator.

# 🚀 Purpose
The goal of this project was to apply the core web development skills we had learned in a practical, hands-on way. We wanted to demonstrate how front-end technologies can be used to build real-world tools that serve meaningful purposes – in this case, a basic calculator for respiratory measurements.

# 💡 What We Learned
Through this project, we strengthened our understanding of:

🏗️ HTML – Structuring forms, inputs, and calculator layout

🎨 CSS – Styling the interface with colors, spacing, and responsiveness

🧠 JavaScript – Capturing user input, performing calculations, and updating results dynamically on the page

# ⚙️ Features
Input fields for respiratory values

Button to trigger calculations

Display area for results

Responsive and clean UI design

# 👨‍💻 Tech Stack
HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript 

# 📌 Status
This is a basic prototype created as part of our learning process. We are proud of what we’ve achieved and are looking forward to improving it with more advanced features in future projects.
